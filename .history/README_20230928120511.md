# MrMacClean

Remove Mac footprint from volume. <br>
For removable Devices. Out of the box **Windows** Script. Start it and feel free.
It creates a **powershell** script **MrMacClean.bat_arbeitet.ps1** to do the work.

TODO: root of a volume and not recursive, make the difference.

Removes Mac files and directories:
### root of a Volume
* .history
* .fseventsd
* .Spotlight-V100
* .Trashes
* .TemporaryItems

### recursive
* .DS_Store
* ._

and more ... just add to the script, but it deletes. It is not reversible.
