Remove Mac footprint. Out of the box Windows Script. Start it and feel free.
It creates an powershell script to do the work.

Removes Mac files and directories:
* .history
* .fseventsd
* .Spotlight-V100
* .Trashes
* .TemporaryItems
* .DS_Store
* ._

and more ... just add to the script, but it deletes. It is not reversible.
